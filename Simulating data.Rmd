# Workshop data - cats <3 and dogs

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Corpus data

collocates from BNC with tags, one position left of CAT/DOG lemma search
```{r}
animal_corpus <- data.frame(
  collocate = c(rep("tom_np1", 9), #cat collocates
              rep("tom_nn1", 8),
              rep("siamese_jj", 17),
              rep("tortoiseshell_nn1", 9),
              rep("ginger_jj", 8),
              rep("purring_jj", 5),
              rep("purring_vvg", 1),
              rep("playing_vvg", 4),
              rep("because_cs", 5),
              rep("contented_jj", 4),
              #dog:
              rep("guide_nn1", 60),
              rep("guide_vv0", 7),
              rep("guide_vvi", 1),
              rep("mad_jj", 52),
              rep("barking_jj", 7),
              rep("barking_vvg", 1),
              rep("barking_np1", 1),
              rep("has_vhz", 19),
              rep("lap_nn1", 17),
              rep("dangerous_jj", 24),
              rep("best_jjt", 4)),
    animal = c(rep("cat", 70), rep("dog", 193))
)

## add: 

# to randomise the order of the rows:
rows <- sample(nrow(animal_corpus))
animal_corpus <- animal_corpus[rows, ]
```

### SPR
```{r}
## Design: 
## cond_a is matching collocates (5 about cats, 5 about dogs),
## cond_b is mismatching collocates (5 with dog collocates + cat, 5 with cat collocates + dog)

### Check out that everything looks good

```{r}
ggplot(data=catdog_spr, aes(x=participant, y=RT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=catdog_spr, aes(x=cond, y=RT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
full_data <- participant_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(participant, values_to="participant") %>% 
  full_join(catdog_spr)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=full_data, aes(x=gender, y=RT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
full_data %>% 
  group_by(pet_interest) %>% 
  summarize(avg_RT = mean(RT)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=pet_interest, y=avg_RT)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=full_data, aes(x=nationality, y=RT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
full_data %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarize(avg_RT = mean(RT)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=education, y=avg_RT)) +
  geom_col()
```


```{r}
mean(catdog_spr$RT)
range(catdog_spr$RT)
```

### Uhhhh not sure why this is happening? ideas?
```{r}
ggplot(data=full_data, aes(x=RT)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=175))
```
