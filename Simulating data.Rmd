# Workshop data - cats <3 and dogs

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Corpus data

collocates from BNC with tags, one position left of CAT/DOG lemma search
```{r}
animal_corpus <- data.frame(
  collocate = c(rep("tom_np1", 9), #cat collocates

## add: 

# to randomise the order of the rows:
rows <- sample(nrow(animal_corpus))
animal_corpus <- animal_corpus[rows, ]

write.csv2(animal_corpus, "cat_dog_corpus_data.csv")
```

## SPR
```{r}
## Design: 
## cond_a is matching collocates (5 about cats, 5 about dogs),
## cond_b is mismatching collocates (5 with dog collocates + cat, 5 with cat collocates + dog)
